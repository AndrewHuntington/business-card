# Business Card

A simple business card originally made as a project for the Learn React course
on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

Currently doubles as my personal website, since I did not like any of the designs of my previous attempts.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Todo

There are still quite a few things I wish to implement yet in this project.

- Add some sort of highlight when a user hovers/focuses on a button
- Implement Japanese support
- Implement Spanish support (maybe)
- Create a QR code to easily share my card with smartphone users
