# Business Card

A simple business card originally made as a project for the Learn React course
on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

Currently doubles as my personal website, since I did not like any of the designs of my previous attempts.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Testing Library

## Todo

There are still quite a few things I wish to implement yet in this project.

- Add some sort of highlight when a user hovers/focuses on a button
- Give some sort of indication of which language is chosen in the lanaguage selector (eg. an underline, highlighting the text, making it opaque, etc.)
- ~~Implement Japanese support~~
- Edit Japanese to make sure it is as close to the English as possible while still sounding natural
- Implement Spanish support (maybe)
- Implement light/dark mode support
- Create a QR code to easily share my card with smartphone users
- The tests could be better, but I don't know if I'll get back to them
